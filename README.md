# Author Time Check

Notifies how valid the Author Time (AT) appears to be based on the map's metadata.

**IMPORTANT:** It is **impossible** to tell if an AT is real or fake, unless an AT ghost is provided.

It is also impossible to tell if an AT is fake, as there might be a valid run on another version or copy of the map, e.g. a version without scenery or a copy sent to a friend.
This plugin therefore only serves as an indicator, as based on the map's metadata, we can infer if a plugin was used or not.

The plugin can give 3 different notifications:
- AT is likely valid (by default no notificaiton. Can be enabled in the settings.)
- AT is likely set by a plugin
- AT might be valid or set by a plugin (inconclusive)

Requires [MLFeed](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/mlfeedracedata) (and consequently [MLHook](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/mlhook)).
